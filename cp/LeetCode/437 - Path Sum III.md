### Things I learnt:
- Learnt about using hashmap in trees.
- How to find the number of subarrays in an array which sum up to a particular value in O(n) time and space.

### Things I missed:
- Arrangement of the lines of code (the impact it has).
- Missed the target=0
- a few testcases I missed
	- \[1, -2, -3\] for target=1
	- \[1,-1,null,1,null,-1,null,0\] for target=0
- Used a global variable
